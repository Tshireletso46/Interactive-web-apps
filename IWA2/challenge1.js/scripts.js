console.log(user, surname);

/* The console did not have log and a full stop.
The comments for the lastname and firstname were not commented correctly. 
I added full stop after the "console".
Added "log"after a full.
Removed semicolon and added a comma between the user and surname.
Move the semicoln after the surname to the closing bracket.
